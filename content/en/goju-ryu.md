Goju-Ryu is one of the main traditional Okinawan styles of karate, featuring a combination of hard and soft techniques. Founded by Chojun Miyagi (1888-1953), Goju-Ryu represents one of the most authentic and historically significant martial arts systems in the world.

## Origins and History

### Ancient Roots in China

The roots of Goju-Ryu can be traced back to ancient Chinese martial arts. In the 19th century, Kanryo Higaonna (1853-1915) traveled to Fuzhou, China, where he studied under the Chinese master Ryu Ryu Ko (Liu Liu Gong). Higaonna learned a system called "Naha-te," which combined both hard linear techniques and soft circular movements.

### The Miyagi Legacy

Chojun Miyagi, who became Higaonna's most prominent student, further developed and systematized these teachings. In 1929, Miyagi named his style "Goju-Ryu," which means "hard-soft style." This name comes from the Chinese classic "Bubishi" and reflects the fundamental principle of combining hard, linear attacks with soft, circular blocks and movements.

## Key Principles of Goju-Ryu

**Go (Hard)**: Represents the linear, powerful techniques including strikes, kicks, and blocks that meet force with force.

**Ju (Soft)**: Embodies the circular, flowing movements that redirect an opponent's energy rather than opposing it directly.

The synthesis of these contrasting elements creates a complete martial art that emphasizes:
- Proper breathing techniques (Ibuki)
- Close-quarter fighting
- Circular blocking and deflection
- Traditional kata (forms)
- Mental and physical conditioning

## Traditional Kata

Goju-Ryu preserves several ancient kata, each with specific purposes:

- **Sanchin**: The fundamental kata focusing on breathing, stance, and internal power
- **Tensho**: Emphasizes soft, flowing movements and breathing
- **Saifa**: Meaning "to tear and destroy"
- **Seiyunchin**: "To control and pull into battle"
- **Shisochin**: "To destroy in four directions"
- **Sanseru**: Representing the number 36
- **Sepai**: Representing the number 18
- **Kururunfa**: "Holding ground"
- **Seisan**: Representing the number 13
- **Suparinpei**: Representing the number 108, the highest kata

## Training Philosophy

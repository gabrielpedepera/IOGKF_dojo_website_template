Goju-Ryu is one of the main traditional Okinawan styles of karate, featuring a combination of hard and soft techniques. Founded by Chojun Miyagi (1888-1953), Goju-Ryu represents one of the most authentic and historically significant martial arts systems in the world. Few fighting arts have as deep and fascinating a history as that of Okinawan Goju-Ryu Karate-do, spanning hundreds of years from Shaolin temple and Chinese boxing origins to its modern international presence.

## The Complete Historical Lineage

### Ryu Ryu Ko → Kanryo Higaonna (1853-1915)

Kanryo Higaonna was born on March 10th, 1853 in Nishimura, Okinawa. He was one of eight siblings from a lower economic class family. His father was a sailor who made his living shipping and trading between the Ryukyu islands and China, always returning with stories of Chinese martial arts.

**The Journey to China:**
In 1867, when Kanryo was 14, his father was killed in a fight. Driven by grief and a desire for revenge, young Kanryo decided to travel to China to learn the deadly fighting arts. He arrived in Fuzhou, Southern China, where he sought out other Okinawans and was eventually introduced to his teacher: **Ryu Ryu Ko**.

**14 Years of Training:**
Ryu Ryu Ko accepted the teenager and made him swear an oath to follow his philosophies and never misuse the martial arts. Kanryo trained every morning, assisting his teacher as a bamboo craftsman and training in the garden. Through brutal training and dedication, he developed incredible power, strength, and speed, eventually becoming a live-in student.

After 14 years of loyal study, in 1891, Ryu Ryu Ko told Kanryo it was time to return to Okinawa. Kanryo left China as an accomplished martial artist with 9 of the current Goju-Ryu kata. Upon returning, his father's killer begged for forgiveness, and remembering his oath to his master, Kanryo graciously forgave him.

### Kanryo Higaonna → Chojun Miyagi (1888-1953)

Chojun Miyagi was born on April 25th, 1888 into a wealthy family. As a youth he was unruly, so at age 11 he was taken to Ryuko Aragaki to learn discipline through karate. Recognizing his potential, Aragaki introduced him to Kanryo Higaonna in 1902.

**The Student Who Learned Everything:**
At 14, Chojun began training under Kanryo Sensei, known as "Ashi no Higaonna" (Legs Higaonna) for his exceptionally strong legs. The training was intense and brutal, but Chojun's dedication was exceptional. Unlike other students who learned only Sanchin and one other kata, Chojun was chosen to learn the entire Naha-te system through private instruction.

**Continuing the Legacy:**
When Kanryo Sensei passed away in 1915, Chojun fulfilled his teacher's final wish by traveling to Fuzhou, China, to research Ryu Ryu Ko's background. Upon returning, he began teaching and further developing the system, creating Tensho kata from the Chinese Rokkishu form and revising Sanchin kata.

### The Birth of "Goju-Ryu" (1930)

In 1930, Chojun Miyagi's student Jin'an Shinzato performed a demonstration in Tokyo for Crown Prince Hirohito's succession celebration. When asked the name of his style, Shinzato wasn't sure how to answer. This prompted Chojun Miyagi to formally name his art.

**The Name from Poetry:**
Miyagi drew inspiration from the Bubishi text's "Kenpo Haku" (eight poems of the fist). The third poem states: "The way of inhaling and exhaling is hardness and softness" (Ho Go Ju donto). From this, Miyagi took "Go Ju" (hard-soft) and added "Ryu" (style), creating **"Goju-Ryu"** in 1930.

**Official Recognition:**
The Japanese Butokukai recognized Goju-Ryu as an official martial art with Chojun Miyagi as its official master. He became famous for his legendary grip, earning the nickname "Nukitui Magushiku" for his ability to tear raw meat apart with his bare hands.

### Chojun Miyagi → An'ichi Miyagi (1931-2009)

World War II devastated Okinawa, and Chojun Miyagi lost many students, including his top student Jin'an Shinzato. The future of Goju-Ryu was uncertain.

**The Last Student:**
An'ichi Miyagi was born on February 9th, 1931, and lost both parents during the Battle of Okinawa when he was 14. On February 1st, 1948, he and four friends began training under Chojun Sensei. The training was so intense that after one year, only An'ichi remained.

**The Chosen Heir:**
Chojun Miyagi tested An'ichi's character through chores and observed his dedication. Recognizing his worthy spirit, Chojun Sensei chose An'ichi to inherit the complete Goju-Ryu system. An'ichi was the only student to learn all the kata, applications, and receive the oral history directly from Chojun Miyagi.

When Chojun Miyagi passed away in October 1953, An'ichi Miyagi became the last person ever taught by the founder and the guardian of authentic Okinawan Goju-Ryu.

### An'ichi Miyagi → Morio Higaonna (1938-2022)

Morio Higaonna was born on December 25th, 1938. At 15, he joined Naha Commercial High School Karate Club and met Tsunetaka Shimabukuro, a former student of Chojun Miyagi, who taught him basic kata and encouraged him to visit the Garden Dojo.

**Entering the Garden Dojo:**
In April 1955, at age 16, Morio Higaonna officially entered Chojun Miyagi's Garden Dojo. An'ichi Miyagi was the class instructor, and Koshin Iha pointed out that An'ichi Sensei was the most knowledgeable teacher.

**Dedication and Recognition:**
Morio trained six days per week at the dojo and Sundays at home. An'ichi Sensei recognized his dedication and would ask him to accompany him to maintain Chojun Sensei's house and dojo. This dedication created a bond that continues to this day.

**International Expansion:**
Morio moved to Tokyo to study at Takushoku University and began teaching at a small dojo in Yoyogi. His reputation grew rapidly, with a famous martial arts historian calling him "the most dangerous man in Japan in a real fight."

### The Formation of IOGKF (1979)

By 1979, Morio Higaonna had a worldwide following. With the blessing of An'ichi Miyagi Sensei and senior students and family members of Chojun Miyagi, he formed the **International Okinawan Goju-Ryu Karate-do Federation (IOGKF)** in Poole, England.

**Modern Recognition:**
- In 1997, IOGKF became a recognized member of the Nihon Kobudo Kyokai (Japan Traditional Martial Arts Association)
- In 2009, before his death, An'ichi Miyagi presented Morio Higaonna with his personal black belt, 10th Dan certificate, and certificate recognizing him as heir to Goju-Ryu in direct line to Chojun Miyagi
- In 2013, Morio Higaonna received an award from the Okinawan government listing him as an Intangible Cultural Treasure

### Morio Higaonna → Tetsuji Nakamura (1965-)

Tetsuji Nakamura was born on April 3rd, 1965 in Osaka, Japan. His journey to Goju-Ryu began with a chance phone call to Shuichi Aragaki Sensei during a university vacation to Okinawa.

**The Path to Mastery:**
After hearing stories about Chojun Miyagi from Aragaki Sensei, Tetsuji became fascinated with Goju-Ryu. Following university graduation, he returned to Okinawa where Aragaki Sensei directed him to train daily at the Higaonna Dojo for six months to prove his dedication.

**Becoming the Successor:**
In 1991, Tetsuji won the IOGKF World Championships. Higaonna Sensei recognized his dedication and invited him to train personally in San Marcos, America. He became Higaonna Sensei's top student and assistant instructor.

**Current Leadership:**
In 2012, at the IOGKF World Budosai, Higaonna Sensei appointed Tetsuji Nakamura as his successor and World Chief Instructor. In 2022, at age 84, Higaonna Sensei stepped down completely from IOGKF.

Today, IOGKF International has over 75,000 members in over 60 countries under Tetsuji Nakamura Sensei's leadership, protecting the cultural treasure of Okinawan Goju-Ryu Karate-do.

## Key Principles of Goju-Ryu

The name "Goju-Ryu" comes directly from the Bubishi's eight poems of the fist, specifically: "The way of inhaling and exhaling is hardness and softness."

**Go (Hard)**: Represents the linear, powerful techniques including strikes, kicks, and blocks that meet force with force.

**Ju (Soft)**: Embodies the circular, flowing movements that redirect an opponent's energy rather than opposing it directly.

The synthesis of these contrasting elements creates a complete martial art that emphasizes:
- Proper breathing techniques (Ibuki)
- Close-quarter fighting
- Circular blocking and deflection
- Traditional kata (forms) passed down through the lineage
- Mental and physical conditioning through Hojo Undo

## Traditional Kata of Goju-Ryu

Goju-Ryu preserves the ancient kata learned by Kanryo Higaonna in China, plus those created by Chojun Miyagi:

**Classical Kata (from China):**
- **Sanchin**: The fundamental kata focusing on breathing, stance, and internal power
- **Saifa**: Meaning "to tear and destroy"
- **Seiyunchin**: "To control and pull into battle"
- **Shisochin**: "To destroy in four directions"
- **Sanseru**: Representing the number 36
- **Sepai**: Representing the number 18
- **Kururunfa**: "Holding ground"
- **Seisan**: Representing the number 13
- **Suparinpei**: Representing the number 108, the highest kata

**Created by Chojun Miyagi:**
- **Tensho**: Developed from the Chinese Rokkishu, emphasizing soft, flowing movements
- **Gekisai Dai Ichi & Dai Ni**: Created in 1940 to make karate more accessible to all ages

## Training Philosophy

Goju-Ryu emphasizes that karate is not merely a fighting system, but a way of life that develops:

**Physical Aspects:**
- Strength and flexibility
- Coordination and balance
- Cardiovascular fitness
- Self-defense capabilities

**Mental Aspects:**
- Discipline and perseverance
- Concentration and focus
- Respect and humility
- Confidence and inner peace

**Spiritual Aspects:**
- Understanding of traditional values
- Connection to martial arts heritage
- Personal growth and self-improvement
- Harmony between mind, body, and spirit

The sacrifices, effort, and commitment of all the masters in this unbroken lineage have kept Okinawan Goju-Ryu alive and stronger than ever.

Today, under the leadership of Sensei Tetsuji Nakamura and the IOGKF, anyone can learn the true art of Chojun Miyagi and those who came before him.

## Foundation and Mission

The International Okinawan Goju-Ryu Karate-do Federation (IOGKF) was established in July 1979 by Sensei Morio Higaonna in Poole, England, to preserve and promote authentic Okinawan Goju-Ryu karate worldwide. The IOGKF was formed with the support and backing of Ken Miyagi (fourth son of Goju-Ryu founder Chojun Miyagi), An'ichi Miyagi (successor to Chojun Miyagi), and senior students of the late Chojun Miyagi.

Since its formation, the IOGKF has grown to have more than 55 affiliated countries and over 75,000 members worldwide, making it one of the largest traditional karate organizations globally.

## Current Leadership

In 2012, Higaonna Sensei took up an advisory role within the Federation and appointed **Sensei Tetsuji Nakamura** as his successor and chief instructor of IOGKF International. Sensei Ernie Molyneux and Sensei Henrik Larsen were also promoted to IOGKF Vice Chief Instructor at the same time, and together the three form the IOGKF International executive committee.

In 2022, at the age of 84, Higaonna Sensei stepped down from his role in IOGKF. The IOGKF International Honbu Dojo is now located in Burlington, Ontario, Canada, where Sensei Tetsuji Nakamura resides.
